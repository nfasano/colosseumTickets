# Colosseum Tickets
Code for webscraping ticket availability for Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill in Rome. 

## Background
Tickets to enter the Colosseum are notoriusly difficult to obtain from the official website (https://www.coopculture.it/it/) as only a limited supply of timed entry tickets are released 30 days in advance, and those tickets are taken by third party bots within seconds of being posted. These third party users then sell the tickets for a mark up, sometimes by up to 10x the original ticket price (). The goal of this code was to determine when is optimal time to purchase a Colosseum ticket from the official website, avoiding the exorbitant fees incurred by using a third party resellers. 

## Conclusions
In conclusion, I suggest the following approach to purchasing tickets at the Colosseum. 
  1) Exactly 30 days before your visit, constantly check the official website for available tickets at a desirable time. Tickets are released on a rolling basis, starting at 9:00am (Rome time). Early morning tickets are nearly impossible to get, but you may get lucky with some afternoon availability. It is likley that you could purchase tickets for entry after 5:30p, but the Colosseum closes at 7:00pm so your visit will be quite short.
  2) If that fails, the next step is to purchase tickets from a third party vendor (e.g. Get your Guide or Viator). These sites usually have an option to get a full refund on your tickets up to 24 hours in advance, which is good since there is still a possibility to get tickets from the official website.
  3) Periodically check the official website for ticket releases (or use the code in this repo to track ticket availablilty and automatically email you with any status changes). The most likley time to find a ticket is exactly 7 days before your visit time, when a second batch of tickets are released.

## Ticket information (see Colosseum website for more details https://parcocolosseo.it/en/visit/opening-times-and-tickets/)
There are two main types of tickets you can purchase: the regular entrance (16 euros) and the full experience (22 euros). The regular ticket allows one timed entry into the Colosseum and one entrance to the archaelogical area which contains the Roman Forum and Palantine. The Full experience has two types of tickets: one that adds access to the arena of the Colosseum and one that adds arena accces and the underground area where the battles took place.
